# NeoPixel
Simple Python Experiments for LED panels. This particular panel is an 8x32 model with 256 pixels, arranged in a down/up/down/up numbering fashion. The panels can be daisy-chained, just remember you need a fair whack of current at 5v to drive them in anger.

I'm not a big Python guy, but some samples here as I figure things out. If you find it useful, great.

If you think the code is shit, it probably is :)
