# NeoPixel
Simple Python Experiments for LED panels. This main dev panel is an 8x32 model with 256 pixels, arranged in a down/up/down/up numbering fashion. The panels can be daisy-chained, just remember you need a fair whack of current at 5v to drive them in anger. Since cut down to 8x18 for the specific use case - wiring is serial, so you can still daisy chain, but it'll need some soldering.

Also been doing some work with rings.

I'm not a big Python guy, but some samples here as I figure things out. If you find it useful, great. It's now been expanded to use BLE remotes and multi-threading etc.

If you think the code is shit, it probably is :)

Basic emulation of the Boss RC-505 looper display...
